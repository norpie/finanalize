    "snippet":"Tesla fourth-quarter results miss estimates as automotive revenue drops 8%. Tesla reported earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter that missed analysts’ estimates. The stock initially fell in after-hours trading before rebounding.

Here is how the company did compared with estimates from analysts polled by LSEG:

Earnings per share: 73 cents adjusted vs. 76 cents expected
Revenue: $25.71 billion vs. $27.26 billion expected
Tesla’s revenue increased just 2% from $25.17 billion a year earlier. Automotive revenue fell 8% to $19.8 billion from $21.56 billion in the same quarter last year, and of that, $692 million came from regulatory credits.

Operating income declined 23% year over year to $1.6 billion.

The company cited reduced average selling prices across its Model 3, Model Y, Model S and Model X lines as a major reason for the decline.

Net income dropped 71% from a year earlier to $2.32 billion, or 66 cents a share, from $7.93 billion, or $2.27 a share. Last year’s net income figure was bolstered by a $5.9 billion one-time noncash tax benefit."

Apple Background

Apple is among the largest companies in the world, with a broad portfolio of hardware and software products targeted at consumers and businesses. Apple's iPhone makes up a majority of the firm sales, and Apple's other products like Mac, iPad, and Watch are designed around the iPhone as the focal point of an expansive software ecosystem. Apple has progressively worked to add new applications, like streaming video, subscription bundles, and augmented reality.

Slightly less than half of Apple's sales come directly through its flagship stores, with a majority of sales coming indirectly through partnerships and distribution."
