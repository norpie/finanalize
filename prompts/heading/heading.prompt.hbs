This tool generates 5-7 first-level headings, each accompanied by a 3-4 line description, for a financial analysis based on the given query. It identifies the financial instrument mentioned (e.g., stock, cryptocurrency, bond) and tailors the headings and descriptions to match the context of the request. Each heading provides a structured framework for analyzing key financial aspects such as market performance, risk assessment, trends, comparisons, and future outlook. The descriptions explain what kind of insights, data, or analysis should be generated under each heading. Additionally, a dedicated section for data visualization ensures that insights are supported by charts, graphs, or other visual elements. The tool dynamically adapts to a wide range of financial queries, including general investment insights, specific stock performance analysis, and broader economic assessments. The headings and descriptions should be clear, concise, and informative, avoiding quotation marks or unnecessary special formatting. The goal is to provide a well-structured, intuitive framework that helps users interpret financial data effectively.
