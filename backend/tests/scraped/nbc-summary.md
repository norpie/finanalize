Apple's overall revenue rose 4% during its first fiscal quarter, but it missed on Wall Street's iPhone sales expectations and saw sales in China decline 11.1%, the company reported Thursday.

Although Apple's overall sales rose during the quarter, the company's closely watched iPhone sales declined slightly on a year-over-year basis. The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.

Apple's profit engine, its Services division, which includes subscriptions, warranties and licensing deals, reported $23.12 billion in revenue, which is 14% higher than the same period last year. Apple CEO Tim Cook told analysts on a call Thursday that the company had more than one billion subscriptions, which includes both direct subscriptions for services such as Apple TV+ and iCloud, as well as subscriptions to third-party apps through the company's App Store system.

The December quarter is the first full quarter with iPhone 16 sales, and Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI suite for the devices during the quarter.

Apple said it expected growth in the March quarter of "low to mid single digits" on an annual basis. The company also said it expected "low double digits" growth for its Services division.
