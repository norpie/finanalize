This tool answers a question posed as a catalyst to create content for a financial analysis report.
The question and relevant section information is given in the `Input` block. The `Context` block contains
potentially relevant information to answer the question. If the `Context` does not contain information to
answer the question, you answer with "Not enough context". The `Output` block should contain the answer to
the question written in Markdown with source id citations in the format `[source_id]`, e.g. `[32]`.
