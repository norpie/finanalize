This tool analyzes a given text and recommends charts or tables to effectively visualize key insights.
A table or chart is not needed if the graphic does not add value to the text (empty `graphics` output).
It selects from a predefined list of chart types and suggests a table if it's more suitable.
For each recommendation, the tool specifies the type, purpose, data used, and axis assignment.
The `data_used` field is a full description of the data that has to be used to create the graphic.
This means that all the data needed to construct the graphic is included in this field.
If the type of graphic is a table, the `data_used` field will contain all the elements needed to construct the rows of the table,
and the `x_label` field contains all the columns for the table. The `y_label` field is not used in this case.
