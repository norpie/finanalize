This tool generates 1-3 sub-section titles per section of the report given: user's request, title of the article, and the section titles.
Generate structured sub-section names for a stock analysis based on the given query.
Sub-section amount can vary depending on the length of the section (intro and conclusions will only have one, whereas the core sections might have the full 3).
Make sure to still give the intro and conclusion sections a sub-section title, even if they are not as detailed.
Sub-section titles should be detailed and informative, but not too long.
We do not do predictions, avoid any future-oriented sections. Avoid unnecessary formatting.
The output is an array `sections` containing section objects, which contain a section title, and `subSections` array of strings.
