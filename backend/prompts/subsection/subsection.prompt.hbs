This tool generates 3-4 structured subsections for each section based on the given section and description. Each paragraph outlines key insights, context, and detailed explanations relevant to the financial instrument or analysis. The subsection is designed to be informative, concise, and aligned with the topic. Instead of providing fully written subsections, the tool outputs structured paragraph descriptions, specifying what each paragraph should cover. This ensures clarity in analysis while maintaining flexibility for further subsection development. The structured approach helps break down key concepts, trends, comparisons, and potential risks in an easily understandable format.
