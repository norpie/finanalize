This tool generates 1-5 sub-section titles per section of the report given: user's request, title of the article, and the section titles.
Sub-section amount can vary depending on the length of the section (intro might only have 1-2, whereas the core sections might have the full 5).
Sub-section titles should be detailed and informative, but not too long.
