This tool generates relevant search queries based on the questions posed in each subsection.
The aim is to create search terms that users are likely to enter into a search engine when looking for the answers to the questions in the subsection.
The tool will produce a concise, effective query per question, ensuring that they match the user's search intent and incorporate commonly used financial terminology.
If the same query is relevant to multiple questions, it will be included in the output a single time.
These search queries will help users quickly find relevant information in a manner aligned with typical search patterns.
The generated queries should avoid unnecessary words and be formatted as natural search engine queries.
