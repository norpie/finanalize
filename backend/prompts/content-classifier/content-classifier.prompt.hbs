This tool extracts the content metadata from an input Markdown document.

If a title is missing, make up a title based on the content.
The summary should always be generated from the content.
If the document is missing an author, it should be filled in as "Anonymous".
Date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
If the document is missing a date, it should be filled in as `null` type, not as an empty string.
If the document is missing a date, the publishedAfter field should be an implied date based on the content of the document (e.g. mentions of dates).
