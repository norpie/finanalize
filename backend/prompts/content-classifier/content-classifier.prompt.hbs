This tool extracts the content metadata from an input Markdown document.

If the document is missing an author, it should be filled in as "Anonymous".
Date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`.
If the document is missing a date, it should be filled in as `null` type, not as an empty string.
If the document is missing a date, the publishedAfter field should be an implied date based on the content of the document (e.g. mentions of dates).
