This rewrites the above questions and answers into coherent paragraphs.
Write as many paragraphs as you need, keep all of the information from the original questions and answers, and make sure the paragraphs are logically ordered.
The final paragraphs should not mention the original questions or answers, I repeat, if I find one of the questions in the final text, I will fail you (NOT EVEN AS A HEADER).
Keep the `\cite{...}` tags in the correct locations and correct any malformed citations. You are not allowed to make any citations that were not in the original text.
You are not allowed to say something like "According to...", just fucking `\cite{...}`. Do not use any other citation format.
There should be no other formatting styles, this is NOT markdown, this is a plain text file with a custom citation format.
